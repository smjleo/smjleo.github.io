                <p>
                    I am a problemsetter for weekly contests on Binary Search, a place for people who want to improve their
                    algorithms and programming skills. The contest consists of 4 questions with varying difficulties, aimed
                    to test contestants' problem solving abilities.

                <h5>MODERATOR, EDUCATOR</h5>

                <p>
                    I worked with <a class="smalla" href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a> and my friend <a class="smalla" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumchoudhuri/">Soum</a> 
                    to conduct online workshops, targeted towards those who are looking to push their
                    competitive programming skills further. We also have created and are maintaining internal 
                    guidelines on the structure and format of future Learning Jams based on the feedback we have received. 
                    These guidelines are currently being used by other Learning Jam organisers to help conduct sessions more successfully.

                <p>
                    United World College Olympiad in Informatics, or UWCOI for short, is an online mirror of the selection test
                    for the UWCSEA NOI (National Olympiad in Informatics) team. As it was a large international contest with
                    over 1400 participants, our roles included answering problem clarifications in real time and creating
                    robust testdata for our tasks, among other logistical challenges.
