                    United World College Olympiad in Informatics, or UWCOI for short, is an Online Mirror of the selection test
                    for the UWCSEA NOI (National Olympiad in Informatics) team. As it was a large international contest with
                    over 1400 participants, our roles included answering problem clarifications in real time and creating
                    robust testdata for our tasks, among other logistical challenges.

                    Take [H]acktion is a team hackathon partnered with Blue Dragon, an organisation based in Vietnam
                    whose aim is to help street kids and children who have been affected by slavery and human trafficking.
                    We designed and developed an idea for an app that can help trafficking victims or prevent
                    possible dangers.

                    Hack&Roll is a hackathon focused on building anything awesome.
                    We built <a href="https://devpost.com/software/padblocker" target="_blank" class="smalla">padblocker</a>, a physical adblocker, using technologies
                    such as Arduino, Flask and Javascript. Even though we didn't win, we built
                    something we are quite proud of (and made the judges laugh).
