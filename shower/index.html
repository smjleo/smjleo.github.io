        <h1>Shower</h1>
        <p>
          They say that your eyes are the window to your soul. If so, showers are the window to your eyes.
          <br><br>
          Think about it -- you're most vulnerable when you take a shower. Everyone has had at least one experience
          where you did things in the shower that you definitely wouldn't have done if you were outside, whether
          it be singing, dancing or talking to yourself.
          <br><br>
          You just become a lot more explicit in showers: you're free from other's judgement, and even from
          wearing clothes. Just imagine how much better society would be if we were all in the showers -- simultaneously.
          A world without judgement; a world without discrimination; a world without clothes.
          <br><br>
          Be like showers.
