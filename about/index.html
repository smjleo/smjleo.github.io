        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Leo, a student at the United World College of Southeast Asia in Singapore - expected to graduate 2022.
            I've previously lived in Yongin, South Korea then Beijing, China before coming to Singapore.
            Thanks to that, I am fluent in English and Korean, as well as
            being moderately proficient in Mandarin Chinese (HSK 5 level). I also love computers,
            music, travelling and sleeping. Unfortunately I usually have to
            ignore my love for sleeping if I want to do any of the other three.
            <br><br>
            I really enjoy competitive programming. I've only started in August 2018, and therefore
            I'm not as skilled as other more experienced competitive programmers yet - but I love it nonetheless.
            I've only competed thrice - 2 times in USACO and 1 time in the National Olympiad in Informatics,
            Singapore (NOI) as one of few representatives for UWCSEA. I was able to get promoted
            to gold in USACO and get a bronze medal in NOI so far.
            <br><br>
            I've been playing the trombone for 5 years now. I'm a member of the Senior Jazz Band and the Symphonic Band at UWCSEA,
            and I've been helping out the trombone section in the Intermediate Jazz Band as well.
            I've loved playing and listening to music for as long as I can remember. My mother claims that
            it is because she played music for me while I was still in her womb.
            <br><br>
            I love taking on new exciting projects and meeting other people with common interests.
