        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Leo, a Korean high school student in Singapore.
            I've previously lived in Yongin, South Korea and Beijing, China before coming to Singapore.
            Thanks to that, I am fluent in English and Korean, and
            proficient in Mandarin Chinese (HSK 5 level).
            <br><br>
            I absolutely love programming. Whether it's building a webapp or going to competitive programming competitions,
            I enjoy every second of it. 
            <br><br>
            Music is a significant part of my life as well. I've been playing the trombone ever since I was 9, and
            I've loved playing and listening to music for as long as I can remember. My mum claims that
            it is because she played music for me while I was still in her womb.
            <br><br>
            I love taking on new exciting projects and meeting other people with similar interests.
            My contact details are at the <a href=../contact class="smalla">contact me</a> section of this website - please don't hesitate to
            leave me an email or a DM if you want to talk!
