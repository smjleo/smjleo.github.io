        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Leo, a student at the United World College of Southeast Asia in Singapore - expected to graduate 2022.
            I've previously lived in Yongin, South Korea then Beijing, China before coming to Singapore.
            Thanks to that, I am fluent in English and Korean, and
            moderately proficient in Mandarin Chinese (HSK 5 level). I also love computers,
            music, and travelling.
            <br><br>
            I really enjoy competitive programming. I've only started in August 2018, and therefore
            I'm not as skilled as other more experienced competitive programmers yet - but I love it nonetheless.
            <br><br>
            Music is a significant part of my life. I've been playing the trombone ever since I was 9, and
            I've loved playing and listening to music for as long as I can remember. My mother claims that
            it is because she played music for me while I was still in her womb.
            <br><br>
            I love taking on new exciting projects and meeting other people with similar interests.
            My contact details are at the <a href=../contact class="smalla">contact me</a> section of this website - don't hesitate to
            leave me an email or a DM if you want to talk!
